            	<b>Three strengths of mine are:</b>
            	<li>Determiniation</li>
            	<li>Patience</li>
            	<li>Discipline</li>
            	<br>

            	<b>Determination: </b>I believe that once I set my mind on doing something, it is possible for me to achieve. At times there is a lack of this strength but it is a work in progress. I realized that determination is a skill that can be learned, to break it down you simply need to figure out what you want and then create healthy habits that increases and better your chances of reaching your goals.<br><br>


            	<b>Patience: </b>Patience is a virtue; the ability to wait for something without frustration is a useful skill and a good personality trait. Being patient also allows me to make better decisions as it enables me to analyze things and situations beyond their face value.<br><br>

            	<b>Discipline: </b> Discipline refers to a set of rules and regulations which are to be adhered to while completing any task or activity. As a student being discipline helps in managing the work given. It prevents me from becoming overwhelemed. I have improved my discipline by creating a mini schedule that I try to stick to.

				<h3>Chapter 4 - Achieve Your Goals</h3>

				<i>This chapter was about setting and achieving your goals; deciding where you want to go and then creating a plan to get you there.</i> It is believed that up to 95% of people don`t set goals and just have them floating around in their heads, instead of writing them down. This chapter made it clear how important setting and working towards clear and precise goals are and how much easier it can make it. I could apply this knowledge to my life by writing down my goals as the simple act of writing down my goals would program my mind on what it is that I want.

				<h3>Chapter 5 – The Proper Use of Time </h3>

			<i>	Time Management was the focus of pillar 5.</i> An important point made was to differentiate between important and urgent tasks, because most people focus on urgent tasks that may just randomly pop up during the day without giving any time or attention to the important tasks.  Your best opportunity each day are those that align with your overall goals and should be what you spend your time on. Don’t just go through the day, get from the day. I can apply what I read from chapter five by developing habits such as writing down all the tasks for the next day and putting the ones of most importance at the top.

				<h3>Chapter 6 – Surround Yourself with the Best People</h3> 

				<i>The people you are around influence you.</i> Your attitude is greatly influenced by the people with whom you associate. You must learn how to associate with the people that already have what you want or whom you would like to become like and disassociate from people who are holding you back, after all, birds of a feather flock together. I can apply information from this chapter by being careful of the friends that I keep because they have an influence on me. For example, instead of hanging around the class clown or time wasters, I should hang around the smart people.

				<h3>Chapter 7 – Be a Life Long Learner </h3>

				<i>	Formal education will make you a living.</i>  Self-education will make you a fortune. Self-education is what you teach yourself.  It is what you learn along the way so that you are constantly improving and growing. It is important to develop a habit of constant learning. I could apply this to my life by developing the habit of reading a book every week and taking courses outside of school that will help develop me as a person.
